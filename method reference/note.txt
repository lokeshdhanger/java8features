Definitions:

> They are used to refer method of functional interface
> They are compact and easy to use or shorthand form of lambda expression.

example:

(x)->System.out.println(x)

its method reference is:

System.out::println


# 4 types of method references

1. method reference to constructor
2. method reference to instance method
3. method reference to static method
4. method reference to instance method of an arbitrary object of a particular types


NOTE:

if functional interface do not have matching method parameters, then method reference won't work.
